# Fandango vs The People


**Project intiotion and reasoning:**

Would you rather watch a movie with an internet rating of 1.5/5 or 4/5 stars? 

Unless like my brother, you participate in a weekly social event named "Trashy Tuesday" which consists of getting a little "influenced" with a couple of friends and watching the lowest rated movies of all time to laugh at the absurdity of the plot or the bad acting, I would assume you would watch the movie that is 4/5 stars.
And with this assumption, comes the realization that people would rather watch movies with the highest ratings.

But what happens when you are a website that provides movie ratings, and also sell online tickets for those movies? One could say that it would logically makes sense for you to rate movies higher to sell more ticket. This is exactly what a company called Fandango was suspected of doing on their website and I would like to launch a further investigation to prove it.


**Project overview:**

- Analyze Fandango's movie ratings through visualization and statistical measures
- Find potential inconsistencies in Fandango's rating aggregation formulas
- Comapre Fandango's movie ratings against other top movie rating sites like RottenTomatoes, IMDB, Metacritic
- Decide whether Fandango is providing inflated movie rating to sell more tickets on their website



**Example:**
*Here are the lowest rated films on each site*

*Most of Fandango's lowest rated films are 3.75/5 stars... They are clearly inflating their ratings.*
