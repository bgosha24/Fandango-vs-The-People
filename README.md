# Fandango vs The People


Project intiotion and reasoning:

Would you rather watch a movie with an internet rating of 1.5/5 or 4/5 stars? 

Unless like my brother, you participate in a weekly social event named "Trashy Tuesday" which consists of getting a little "influenced" with a couple of friends and watching the lowest rated movies of all time to laugh at the absurdity of the plot or the bad acting, I would assume you would watch the movie that is 4/5 stars.
And with this assumption, comes the realization that people would rather watch movies with the highest ratings.

But what happens when you are a website that provides movie ratings, and also sell online tickets for those movies? One could say that it would logically makes sense for you to rate movies higher to sell more ticket. This is exactly what a company called Fandango was suspected of doing on their website and I would like to launch a further investigation to prove it.
